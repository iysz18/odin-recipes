<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    I'm going to show you this very old-school method of 
    making beef tips, which, once made, can be used to 
    top lots of things—but my favorite thing to top with 
    tips is probably Tater Tots®. And if you're looking 
    for new ways to prepare lean, cheap, tough cuts of beef, 
    this is one of my all-time favorite methods. You can give 
    this an upgrade by topping with diced red onion, grated 
    Cheddar cheese, and freshly sliced green onions, or you 
    can serve the beef tips over hot mashed potatoes instead of 
    tots, if you like.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 pounds beef round steak</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 teaspoon tomato paste</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 1/4 cups low-sodium beef broth</li>
    <li>1 (28 ounce) package frozen bite-size potato nuggets (such as Tater Tots)</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Slice beef into 3/4-inch strips; then slice these pieces, at an angle, 
            into smaller "tips." Season beef with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce heat to medium and add tomato paste, garlic, and butter. Stir 
            everything until the butter melts, and then stir in the flour. Cook 
            and stir for 1 minute. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat until shimmering. Transfer in beef, 
            arranging in a single layer. Let the meat sear until browned, 3 to 5 minutes,
            before turning over and browning the other side. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in broth. Raise heat to high and bring to a simmer. Reduce to low, cover, 
            and cook until beef is starting to get tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 
        </li>
        <li>
            While meat simmers, bake potato nuggets in the preheated oven until 
            crispy and heated through, 20 to 25 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Taste beef tips and adjust the seasoning. Serve immediately over hot potato nuggets. 
        </li>
    </ol>
