            Welcome to the Odin Recipe Website! 
            This project was created as part of 
            my journey into web development. As 
            a newcomer to programming websites, 
            I embarked on this project with the 
            goal of learning and improving my web 
            development skills. I have been using 
            The Odin Project as a valuable learning 
            resource throughout this journey.
