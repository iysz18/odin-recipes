# Odin Recipe Website
Welcome to the **Odin Recipe Website**! This project was created as part of my journey into web development. As a newcomer to programming websites, I embarked on this project with the goal of learning and improving my web development skills. I have been using The Odin Project as a valuable learning resource throughout this journey.

# Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to create a website that serves as a repository for various recipes. It also
demonstrates my current skill set and knowledge I gathered from my journey to become a self-taught web-developer.

# About The Odin Project
[The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/about) is an open-source, online curriculum for learning web development. It offers a structured and comprehensive path for beginners to gain practical skills in full-stack web development. This project is a part of my coursework in The Odin Project, where I am applying what I've learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies to build a functional website.

# What This Repository Contains
In this repository, you will find the source code and assets for the Odin Recipe Website. The website is built using HTML and CSS. Later I'll add JavaScript to provide an interactive and user-friendly experience. Here's an overview of the repository's contents:

* index.html: The main HTML file that defines the structure and content of the website's homepage.
* styles.css: The CSS file containing styles and layouts for the website, ensuring an attractive and responsive design.interactions.
* imgs/: This directory contains images and media assets used on the website.
* recipes/: A directory where recipe files are stored. Each recipe is represented as a separate HTML file with its instructions, ingredients, and images.
